			<strong> Unreal Engine</strong> is an amazing software that allows you to
			create virtual worlds and visually stunning games. There are plenty of
			resources available to help you learn, but one of the best ways is to

			He has multiple 5-hour videos that are completely free. Don't be
			intimidated by the length - it's definitely worth it to kickstart your
			Unreal Journey with this

		<h3 class="title">Web Dev</h3>

		<p>
			<strong>Web Development</strong> is currently one of the most sought-after
			skills to acquire, and it's also one of the most affordable. What I mean
			by that is you can start learning and honing your skills without spending
			a single penny on lessons (excluding your internet costs and the purchase
			of a laptop or PC). The web development community is incredibly
			compassionate and kind, and they freely share their high-quality knowledge
			to make the web accessible for everyone and create a better online
			environment. So, keep this in mind when you're working on your own website
			next time.

			<br /><br />

			Everything begins with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which
			is just a fancy term for a simple yet complex "Editor." In our case, it's
			a Code Editor. There are plenty of amazing editors out there, and as time
			goes by, you'll develop your own preferences. But I recommend starting
			with
			<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Visual Studio Code</a>.
			You'll fall in love with its extensive list of extensions, which make
			coding adventures much easier, faster, and more enjoyable.

			<br /><br />

			I could provide you with hundreds of links to start learning web
			development, but a great starting point for me (and probably for you too)
			was
			<a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe's</a>
			wonderful book. He has written two books, one for beginners and another
			for more advanced topics. I found his work to be highly informative,
			entertaining, and comprehensive, covering every aspect of web development.
			What's even better is that he includes numerous references throughout his
			books, allowing you to delve even deeper if you wish. I was truly
			impressed and found it incredibly useful. So, give it a try to kickstart
			your web development career. I actually purchased his book, just to show
			my appreciation. Even though he generously shared his knowledge for free.

			<br /><br />

			You might also want to check out the fantastic documentation from
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>. It's an
			invaluable resource that you can refer to whenever you have any questions.

			<br /><br />

			In fact, if you'd like to have access to my
			<strong>web development bookmarks</strong> and a list of my
			<strong>Visual Studio Code extensions</strong> (which includes over 70
			useful pages and about 35 extensions), simply submit your email address in
			the form below. You will get access and of course, it's completely free.
			Don't worry, I won't spam your mailbox. My web development bookmarks
			contain a wealth of information that can greatly assist you in your
			journey. You'll definitely thank me later for that.
